### Goals
1. Feature my most recent projects during my software engineering immersive course at General Assembly
2. Clean, minimalist design
3. Links to my LinkedIn profile & GitHub repositories

### Future Dev
1. Add a light / dark theme toggle button
2. Add a nav bar that takes me to:
- my blog
- a projects page that shows all projects (old & new)
- contact form
3. Add background animation! Cherry blossoms? Laser beams? A little cat that walks all around the edge of the browser?
